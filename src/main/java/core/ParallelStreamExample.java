/**
 * we have a list of employees, and we need to:
 *
 * Filter employees earning more than 50,000.
 * Increase their salaries by 10%.
 * Collect the updated employee list.
 * Instead of processing this sequentially, we will use parallel streams to speed up the computation.
 *
 * Why Use Parallelism Here?
 * If the employee list is large (millions of records), parallel processing significantly reduces processing time.
 * Multi-core utilization â†’ Instead of one core processing everything, multiple cores handle different parts of the list simultaneously.
